## About Me / Portfolio Page

This is my attempt to create a responsive webpage based only on the static images provided.  It has proven to be the most difficult homework assignment yet, but I chalk that up to being too much of a perfectionist.  I feel this is a fairly accurate representation based on the images provided.

This has greatly improved my knowledge and understanding of Bootstrap.  Given more time, I'm sure I could do an even *more* faithful representation of the provided web page images. 

I relied heavily on the provided images and did my best to faithfully and accurately depict the header, footer, and style/colors.  Through lots of trial and error, I found what kinds of thing work -- what's possible and what's not.

I feel good about the finished product -- all the hard work finally paid off!
